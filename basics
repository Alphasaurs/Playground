iostream.h and conio.h are called preprocessor statements.
#include<iostream.h> is used in C++ in order to include the header file “iostream” in the program. Iostream is used to invoke the commonly used functions like cout,cin in a C++ program. Iostream stands for input output stream.
#include<conio.h> is used in both C as well as C++. It is used to include the header file “conio” in a program. Conio is used to invoke the functions related to the output of the program like clrscr(),getch() etc. Conio stands for console input output.
#include<cstdio>(stdio.h) is used to for scanf, printf, %d and other .
#include<cstdlib>(stdlib.h) for dynamic memory allocation also for abs.

using namespace std;
A namespace is designed to overcome this difficulty and is used as additional information to differentiate similar functions, classes, variables etc. with the same name available in different libraries. Using namespace, you can define the context in which names are defined. In essence, a namespace defines a scope.
eg,
#include <foo> 
#include <iostream> 
// Use cout of std library 
std::cout << "Something to display"; 
// Use cout of foo library 
foo::cout < "Something to display"; 
inshort dont use it for big projects

cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n')
This line ignores the rest of the current line, up to '\n' or EOF - whichever comes first:
'\n' sets the delimiter, i.e. the character after which cin stops ignoring
numeric_limits<streamsize>::max() sets the maximum number of characters to ignore. Since this is the upper limit on the size of a stream, you are effectively telling cin that there is no limit to the number of characters to ignore.

you should use -> 
for(auto& it : s) {
cout<<it<<endl;
}
instead of
for(auto it =s.begin(); it !=s.end(); it++){
cout<<*it <<endl;
}
