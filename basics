iostream.h and conio.h are called preprocessor statements.
#include<iostream.h> is used in C++ in order to include the header file “iostream” in the program. Iostream is used to invoke the commonly used functions like cout,cin in a C++ program. Iostream stands for input output stream.
#include<conio.h> is used in both C as well as C++. It is used to include the header file “conio” in a program. Conio is used to invoke the functions related to the output of the program like clrscr(),getch() etc. Conio stands for console input output.
#include<cstdio>(stdio.h) is used to for scanf, printf, %d and other .
#include<cstdlib>(stdlib.h) for dynamic memory allocation also for abs.

using namespace std;
A namespace is designed to overcome this difficulty and is used as additional information to differentiate similar functions, classes, variables etc. with the same name available in different libraries. Using namespace, you can define the context in which names are defined. In essence, a namespace defines a scope.
eg,
#include <foo> 
#include <iostream> 
// Use cout of std library 
std::cout << "Something to display"; 
// Use cout of foo library 
foo::cout < "Something to display"; 
inshort dont use it for big projects

cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n')
clear buffer before taking new line
'\n' sets the delimiter, i.e. the character after which cin stops ignoring
when using it include #include<ios> and #include<limits>

you should use -> 
for(auto& it : s) {
cout<<it<<endl;
}
instead of
for(auto it =s.begin(); it !=s.end(); it++){
cout<<*it <<endl;
}

r_area.Rectangle::display(); ? accessing base class as r_area is an object of child class.

double f=5.14159; ??#include <iomanip>  
cout<<setprecision(5)<<f //5.1416 ??Set decimal precision
Sets the decimal precision to be used to format floating-point values on output operations.
cout<<setprecision(9)<<f //5.14159
cout<<fixed<<setprecision(5)<<f //5.14159 
cout<<fixed<<setprecision(5)<<f //5.141590000
